# VariabilitySelection
Datasets and R code used in Cohen et al.

All R code related to the capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and cross-correlation analyses and plots are found in the "code" folder. Analyzed datasets are found in the "original datasets" folder. Datasets produced from cleaning or wrangling original datasets are found in the "modified datasets" folder. If you clear your workspace each time before running code in each separate R code file, you will need to read in datasets from "modified folders" (I provide code to do this in each R code file). Files produced during the CMR analyses, as well as the final results, are in the "CMR files" folder.
